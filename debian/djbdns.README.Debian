djbdns for Debian
-----------------

This package provides the djbdns programs, installed into /usr/bin/, and
man pages.  When configuring and enabling djbdns services, please note
that daemontools' default directory for services on Debian is
/etc/service/, not /service/.

See http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html for detailed documentation.
